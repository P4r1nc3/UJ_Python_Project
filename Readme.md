# Python Database Project 

This repository contains a final project for the Python course at the Jagiellonian University in Cracow in the academic year 2022/2023.

The program is a simple database created using libraries such as `pymysql` and `tkinter`. It allows users to manage and interact with a database by providing an intuitive graphical user interface.

## Features

The program provides the following features:

- Graphical user interface for interacting with the database
- Add new records to the database
- View and edit existing records
- Delete records from the database
- Search for records in the database based on specific criteria
- Sort records based on different criteria

## Database structure

The program is designed to work with a simple database structure that consists of a single table with the following fields:

- **id** - the unique identifier of the record
- **make** - the make of the car
- **model** - the model of the car
- **colour** - the colour of the car
- **year** - the year of manufacture of the car
- **mileage** - the mileage of the car
- **type** - the type of the car
